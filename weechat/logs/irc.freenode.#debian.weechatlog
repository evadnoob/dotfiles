2016-12-13 16:18:12	awal1	when you install fluxbox or any other WM, debian , via update-alternatives, selects it as the default, as I understand

2016-12-13 16:18:48	echosystm	how does sid compare to arch?
2016-12-13 16:19:10	echosystm	my understanding is that arch is "stable at any point in time" ie. if you installed arch today, it would be stable
2016-12-13 16:19:10	robotustra	how to mount it manually?

2016-12-13 16:20:02	dantheperson	Helllo
2016-12-13 16:20:05	awal1	but if you install openbox and fluxbox, I dont understand why update-alternatives choose openbox as default giving him a higher priority. maybe it's bcuz openbox provides x-session-manager too
2016-12-13 16:20:21	echosystm	ie. packages could be released broken with the intention of fixing in development etc.

2016-12-14 12:07:21	sappel	Good evening. I'm currently running debian on a small gateway server to establish 2 strongswan VPN connections using virtual tunnel interfaces (VTI). I get both vpns up and running, but only though one I'm able to send data.
2016-12-14 12:07:29	`Kevin	pfsmorigo: as others pointed out... the newline might be preventing post-up from being associated with eth, and/or lack of indentation ... you should try both to see if that resolves anything
2016-12-14 12:07:51	pfsmorigo	somiaj, Brigo: I believe that my understanding is wrong. I was thinking that up and down were related to the link, like if I disconnect the cable or plug it back in.
2016-12-14 12:08:16	pfsmorigo	But if seems only when you turn the interface up or down, right?

2016-12-14 12:08:37	sappel	the debian gateway runs behind a pfsense firewall. I tried to capture the traffic with tcpdump to be able to compare, but everything looks fine there. I tried running it directly connected to WAN and suddenly it works...any idea how I can find out if it is the server or the firewall?
2016-12-14 12:08:44	greycat	A cable disconnection generally does not bring the interface down.  It's just a transient error condition.
2016-12-14 12:09:04	greycat	The interface should resume sending & receiving when the cable problem is repaired.

2016-12-14 14:24:36	franglais125	I'm trying to write a polkit policy for apt, so that I can check for updates without entering the password. However it seems that the policy is *too* permissive. I want to restrict to "apt update" only, so that the password is stil required for things like "install, upgrade, purge" etc. Now, in my policy file, this line: ``<annotate key="org.freedesktop.policykit.exec.argv1">update</annotate>`` has no effect, and all apt commands

2016-12-15 13:17:25	greycat	Perhaps it's because your cron jobs run without *any* LANG variable at all, and something defaults to LANG=C instead of LANG=en_US.utf8  ??  Just a guess.

2016-12-15 13:53:34	greycat	It is not optional.  It is MANDATORY.  If your script doesn't have one, then any attempt to execute your script normally will fail.  If this failure occurs inside a shell, the shell will arbitrarily spawn a COPY OF ITSELF to read your script.

2016-12-16 11:08:41	johnkeates	ShaRose: also, don't install from complete IDE-R media, NFS or HTTP or PXE works better
2016-12-16 11:08:44	somiaj	TheChubu: the more standard approach is to use a seperate partition for /home and /var and then use say tmpfs for /tmp, but yoursetup just requires manuall intervention. Just make sure you copy permisions (or move things) correctly next time.

But for your use /tmp could really live in tmpfs, and I would just put a few gigs aside and keep var seperate.

2016-12-16 15:44:02	Gustorn	as WM you must pick i3 on debian

2016-12-16 15:45:01	random_numbers	Unless you mean to use an older-style phone with an actual keyboard, but that's less common.

2016-12-16 15:48:02	jscoder	Gustorn: cydia is just like adding a 3rd party app store to your phone to install deb packages that contain software not available on itunes store. as I said, running a desktop os on a phone isn't going to work.
2016-12-16 15:48:06	random_numbers	jscoder: Probably not, given that broadband chips being capable of exploiting DMA, you have to remove it.

2016-12-16 15:51:53	Gustorn	yeah but without debian I won't have the colours
2016-12-16 15:52:43	jscoder	I had an ipod touch 3rd gen jailbroken with cydia and I used it with synergy and could take the mouse right off my debian laptop onto the ipod

2016-12-22 15:05:39	TamaMcGlinn	nope, still getting problems with libgbm1 saying that I am trying to install version 10 instead of 12. Some of those packages don't have a version 12.0.4-2~bpo8+1, so the install command became this:
2016-12-22 15:05:41	TamaMcGlinn	sudo apt-get install -t jessie-backports libegl1-mesa:amd64=12.0.4-2~bpo8+1 libegl1-mesa:i386=12.0.4-2~bpo8+1 libgl1-mesa-dri:amd64=12.0.4-2~bpo8+1 libgl1-mesa-dri:i386=12.0.4-2~bpo8+1 libopenvg1-mesa:amd64 libopenvg1-mesa:i386 libwayland-egl1-mesa:amd64=12.0.4-2~bpo8+1 libwayland-egl1-mesa:i386=12.0.4-2~bpo8+1 libgl1-mesa-glx=12.0.4-2~bpo8+1 libllvm3.8 libdrm-amdgpu1:i386 libllvm3.8:i386
2016-12-22 15:06:28	TamaMcGlinn	but the error message is exactly the same, so I don't think that the adfixes made any difference to the command. I'm already specifying that it should take them from jessie-backports anyway

2016-12-22 15:08:27	TamaMcGlinn	I'm trying to get my graphics card working again; I installed libgl1-mesa-glx from jessie backports, then deinstalled just that package with dpkg, because I wanted to downgrade again

Please keep the discussions in #debian on-topic and take longer discussions and non-support questions to #debian-offtopic.  Imagine the chaos if each of the hundreds of people in the channel felt the need to wander off topic for a few minutes every day.

2017-01-06 14:10:26	n4dir	as far i can see: to be able to connect to a machine or to login into an account you would first have all to to run some kind of service which would enable that.
2017-01-06 14:10:45	n4dir	I can't see how that should work without doing such (ssh server, vnc-server, something like that)
2017-01-06 14:10:50	⚡	nmschulte is now known as Guest2851
2017-01-06 14:10:56	echosystm	theres absolutely no way this could be exposed if i had ssh enabled?
2017-01-06 14:11:03	echosystm	or is that exactly what i'm doing
2017-01-06 14:11:24	echosystm	i do need to enable ssh from time to time
2017-01-06 14:11:27	n4dir	if you got password authentication for ssh? Never tried that, but i would assume then whoever knows the username can ssh to it
2017-01-06 14:12:01	DoberMann	remote login for users that don't have password should be disabled by default
2017-01-06 14:12:01	n4dir	use authentication via ssh-keys, and the problem is solved ( i think)
2017-01-06 14:12:09	echosystm	hang on
2017-01-06 14:12:26	echosystm	if i set a password on the user (that i never actually use), i'm safe right?
2017-01-06 14:12:35	DoberMann	no
2017-01-06 14:12:46	DoberMann	it will allow remote (ssh ?) login
2017-01-06 14:12:50	jscoder	as long as someone doesnt manage to get your key. and just because you use a key doesn't mean you can't also use a password
2017-01-06 14:13:10	echosystm	DoberMann: but they would need to know the password to login right?

2017-01-06 14:15:45	jscoder	echosystm: you can disable an account if its going to solely use autologin that prevents any actual login from happening
2017-01-06 14:15:59	DoberMann	yes, but is you set a password this will enable the remote password login ability
2017-01-06 14:16:04	n4dir	differnt question would be: from where to where do you ssh? Is it over the internet or in the LAN? How many persons use the LAN? etc ...
2017-01-06 14:16:42	echosystm	ssh is just over lan, but this is all just theoretical; i dont want to shoot myself in the foot with something i dont understand

2017-01-09 10:43:36	WildPenguin	ok
2017-01-09 10:44:09	greycat	Debian does very little "by default".  It's extremely flexible.  You install what you want, and don't install what you don't want.
2017-01-09 10:44:11	WildPenguin	is Debian better for beginners than Fedora? I am a Linux novice.
2017-01-09 10:45:15	R0b0t1	I don't mean to speak ill of fedora, but in my experience I have had less problems with software in the Debian repositories. At the same time, there is a user segment of the Debian community which researches and implements utility one would typically only find Gentoo or Arch users using (e.g. new hardware features of motherboards, binary games, virtualization).
2017-01-09 10:45:56	WildPenguin	ok. I'll stick to Debian, then.
2017-01-09 10:46:00	greycat	That said, Debian's long release cycle means that often, the stable release can't handle bleeding edge hardware.

2017-01-10 11:28:46	nmschulte	How can I verify that cron / anacron work as I expect?  IIUC, anacron sets up a cron.hourly job which in turn uses some heuristics to run cron.daily and related jobs as close to the interval as possible.  Does this work when I just install cron and anacron?  The anacron systemd unit / service / job is inactive, but I've seen it active before.

2017-01-11 10:40:10	CutMeOwnThroat	rsync should have been able to do it , but … couldn't find it in options

2017-01-11 10:41:11	n4dir	if it was me i would prefer to be safe, overhead or not. either sshfs or rsync the remote file back and diff locally (or rsync the local file and diff remote)
2017-01-11 10:42:40	CutMeOwnThroat	I just sshd in and looked at file sizes… but that just seemed like something not uncommon…
2017-01-11 10:42:57	n4dir	-u rsync only if the remote file is elder, not accessed (in plain words, the man page puts it a bit weird)
2017-01-11 10:43:20	n4dir	shaky ground, this way or the other.

2017-01-11 11:50:20	R0b0t1	I ask because it's a matter of interest - it is the reason I switched to Gentoo away from Ubuntu/Debian. It was easier to just have everything be bleeding edge.

2017-01-11 12:02:39	sruli	somiaj: it hangs the vm, i added GFX_MODE=1024x768 but did not make a difference, what kvm drivers are you refering too?

2017-01-11 12:03:42	R0b0t1	Oh hah it needs the first version installed. My apologies, just tried them one after another
2017-01-11 12:03:51	somiaj	sruli: but I'm unsure on how to use this to set the display. I think it tries to set this from the EDID of the attached monintor and I don't know of any way to just set the resolution it boots up into.
2017-01-11 12:04:20	somiaj	R0b0t1: in general when installing jessie-backports it is safest to first install the jessie package, then upgrade it to the jessie backports version with 'apt-get -t jessie-backports install packagename'
2017-01-11 12:04:40	somiaj	R0b0t1: This way you get all the dependencies from jessie and then only upgrade the needed components to jessie-backports

2017-01-11 12:05:55	R0b0t1	somiaj: Makes sense. But how do I access the newly installed version? Running qemu with `qemu-kvm` has been deprecated (unless Debian supplies a binary, which it seems not to) and `qemu-system-x86_64 -version` returns 2.12.

2017-01-11 12:43:43	phogg	treaki__: you should be able to switch to VT2 during the install and after the disks are detected and mounted make arbitrary changes to the system. Might be tricky to get in between the install grub step and the umount step.
2017-01-11 12:44:11	phogg	doing it afterwards is much simpler

2017-01-11 12:44:45	treaki__	i guess i just have to wait for tasksel to install it and do it before/while the selection of the boot medium (sda or something else question)

2017-01-11 12:46:39	Pavr	unless you have it on another disk drive and you mess up the boot order in your BIOS

2017-01-11 12:47:25	Pavr	tbh just do it afterwards. trying to do it while installation is just making things harder then it needs to be.

As long at the version of GRUB you're can detect all the boot devices it shoud be fine. Does every partition need to have a "boot" flag enabled on it for GRUB to use it?
