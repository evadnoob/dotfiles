2016-12-22 11:47:06	aradapilot	if the host is designed to be able to have that many running without issues, there's really no harm in always having them around

2017-01-03 13:09:46	xemdetia	well, and you are in the one of the cases where a view is a solution- someone else is dictating how they access data and you are trying to work around them. It gives them an object to pull records from even though it's really sourced from other stuff

2017-01-03 13:10:47	xemdetia	it is not generally recommended to do views of views, and in MySQL land it's good to avoid doing things that end up as TEMPTABLE. You might want to read this page if you haven't already http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/view-algorithms.html
2017-01-03 13:11:37	xemdetia	at the end of that page you will find reference to the fact you are using a GROUP BY so MySQL forces a temptable where a merge might be ok

2017-01-03 16:15:13	EGreg	what happened to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID#Durability
2017-01-03 16:15:16	EGreg	The durability property ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of power loss, crashes, or errors. In a relational database, for instance, once a group of SQL statements execute, the results need to be stored permanently (even if the database crashes immediately thereafter). To defend against power loss, transactions (or their effects) must be recorded in a non-volatile memory.

2017-01-04 10:16:29	snoyes	If the index includes all selected columns, then it's a "covering index" and can be handled with just the index, without going to the data at all.
2017-01-04 10:16:54	snoyes	But of course there's a trade off in that it requires more memory.
2017-01-04 10:16:56	WhereIsMySpoon	yes but i dont want to have to make a covering index if its uneeded, it makes the query longer if it has more data

2017-01-04 10:53:39	aradapilot	well, first, check if it's mysql that's using the swap space, you might have some other thing running which isn't really used and got swapped out.  can check quickly in top.

2017-01-04 10:54:19	aradapilot	second, check the swap activity.  if it's not much, it's not *good* but it's probably not hurting you.  linux swap algorithms are pretty smart about getting the less used stuff out first.
2017-01-04 10:55:22	aradapilot	honestly, if you were having a major swap issue, it'd be immediately visible - mysql (like most databases) depends so much on memory access being fast that it'll be a horrible crawl if anything oft used is swapped out
2017-01-04 10:56:01	aradapilot	check the host swappiness, on any db server it should be 0 or 1 (value depends on your kernel, 1 is more common nowadays)

2017-01-04 11:00:43	aradapilot	else, can turn down some memory settings.  idle connections or cached threads use about 280k by default.  buffer pool is the main consumer.  vars like key_buffer_size should be only a couple megs at most, some configs have it at like 128M which is useless
2017-01-04 11:00:55	aradapilot	you have a baseline to compare it to, pre swap?

2017-01-04 11:02:14	psynor	we didnt replicate the parameters for mysqld
2017-01-04 11:02:22	psynor	reason is, we had apples and oranges
2017-01-04 11:02:32	psynor	i didnt want to bring over a conf from an unlike server
2017-01-04 11:02:42	psynor	so i stuck with the defaults that RDS provides

2017-01-04 11:04:22	aradapilot	what I'd do is open a ticket with amazon to get some details, and in the mean time, keep an eye on throughput.  if it drops and swap activity increases, you know exactly where the problem is.  don't wait for it to degrade into an outage.  Maybe spend some time going over show global variables and see what looks off - oracle's defaults aren't what I'd call enterprise-ready, for a variety of reasons, and I'd imagine amazon's d
2017-01-04 11:04:22	aradapilot	efaults aren't much better
2017-01-04 11:04:34	psynor	from what data i have the old server was using about 200MB swap prior to being migrated
2017-01-04 11:04:57	aradapilot	a little swap is usually fine, but considering it can cause a complete outage, it's definitely something to think aboutt
2017-01-04 11:05:03	psynor	yeah
2017-01-04 11:05:06	psynor	and whats worse
2017-01-04 11:05:13	psynor	is they tell you how much swap you use
2017-01-04 11:05:21	psynor	but they dont tell you how much swap is available
2017-01-04 11:05:34	psynor	so i have no idea if im using 100MB of 1024MB
2017-01-04 11:05:39	psynor	or 64GB
2017-01-04 11:05:48	psynor	so i set monitors on it
2017-01-04 11:05:54	aradapilot	heh, that's silly
2017-01-04 11:05:56	psynor	but didnt know what threshold is concerning
2017-01-04 11:05:58	psynor	in my mind
2017-01-04 11:06:02	psynor	anything is really
2017-01-04 11:06:10	psynor	so i think i have it to like 500MB for warning

2017-01-04 13:28:39	pancakes9	I'm trying to load a CSV file into an empty database, is there a way for MySQL to figure out the scheme and create the tables from the file data or do I have to manually create the tables?

2017-01-05 11:24:33	Leolo_2	MasterX - mysql can only use one index at a time.  do you have an index that will be used by WHERE clause?

2017-01-05 11:26:40	snoyes	MasterX: It's possible that there is some timeout, either in PHP or MySQL, which could be adjusted. But it makes sense to first see if we can make that 15 seconds smaller.

2017-01-06 09:55:41	passage	DjKad: his php libraries are irrelevant to this issue
2017-01-06 09:56:22	mfoo	Hello. I have a query with a sequence of LEFT OUTER JOINs that behaves differently in MySQL 5.5 and 5.6 - in 5.6 the order is reversed. The query plan is the same for both. I assume I'm relying on some behaviour due to not providing an ORDER BY, but I'd like to confirm that. I can see that http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/select.html mentions that relying on implicit GROUP BY sorting in 5.6 is deprecated, but don't see an equivalent for OUTER JOINs.
2017-01-06 09:56:49	passage	BillyCrook: in order to troubleshoot this you'll need to get apache/php out of the testing, and use the mysql cli client instead
2017-01-06 09:56:53	DjKad	passage: you right, it seems more a problem of .sock path

2017-01-06 09:59:32	mfoo	salle: ok, this makes sense, and we're probably relying on it always being the same in many places (in practice it is) - it's just odd that it seems to be reliably using the natural order of the leftmost join table in 5.5 and not in 5.6

2017-01-06 11:15:01	Nightelf	salle, I don't normally restart it unless there's a reason, such as, configuration changes. Very rare tho as most of the variables can be changed dynamically.
2017-01-06 11:15:09	Nightelf	But, just in case I restarted mysql for conf changes I wouldn't like to have a new binglog generated. specially, if i'm experimenting with binlogs as a backup solution.

2017-01-06 11:15:17	Nightelf	right now, i have 2 backup instance runnings, one for backing up the database once everyday then upload it to multiple cloud servers and the other instance is backing up the database every 2 hours locally.
2017-01-06 11:15:25	Nightelf	as the database is big and doesn't change frequently, backing up the whole database everyday doesn't seem to be a cost efficient solution, so, my idea is to enable binlogs on a mounted directory over ssh( as an example) and back up the binlog everyday to the clouds and the whole database only once every month and reset binglogs.
2017-01-06 11:15:43	Nightelf	with that, i'd also get rid of the local backups and will be able to rollback the database to any specific time on a day or filter bad queries.
2017-01-06 11:16:10	Nightelf	so the folder structure for the backup would be as follow, archives/db/2017/January/{db.gz, bin.001, bin.002}

I'm starting to lean towards using a scripting lang like python as intermediate step, but would like to know if there is a more direct way.

2017-01-06 12:19:07	aradapilot	consider: stored procedure in a local unreplicated system db (binlog-ignore-db), needs to create a view in another replicated db, and have the "create" replicate.  due to mysql's implementation, SP's can't change their default database, and ddl gets repl filtered by default database.  think of any workaround doable within a procedure?  i can always write a script for it, but meh
2017-01-06 12:19:58	aradapilot	it is a task that is ideally triggered through sql, and my shell interface plugin has a delay

2017-01-11 12:12:01	GrandPa-G	for each flavor and the day of the week, i.e. 'vanilla', 1. I want get a report by day of the week so that there are only 7 rows returned, with each column representing the flavor and having a value of it total count for the year for that day.
2017-01-11 12:12:05	GrandPa-G	Any ideas?
2017-01-11 12:12:22	domas	GrandPa-G: aggregates may work!

2017-01-11 12:25:54	GrandPa-G	do you mean adding a group by like select flavor, dayofweek, count(*) from tb group by flavor, dayofweek? that doesn't solve the problem stated.
2017-01-11 12:26:49	svartoyg	not exactly what i meant, but you're right - it's not the solution

2017-01-11 14:55:30	Shatnerz	hello
2017-01-11 14:56:02	Shatnerz	hey, I have a kinda general question involving hashing a ssn to insert into a column and then indexing that column (sorry if this is a duplicate, not sure if this is sending)
2017-01-11 14:57:04	Shatnerz	how would you guys go about that? I was using sha256 and pbkdf2, but I didn't realize I could only have a 64bit BIT column at max

2017-01-11 15:02:32	aradapilot	Shatnerz: data type 'binary'
2017-01-11 15:02:55	aradapilot	'bit' type is for boolean flags
2017-01-11 15:02:57	aradapilot	not binary data
2017-01-11 15:03:40	aradapilot	like a really simple hash would be `md5_hash_col` binary(16); insert into table set md5_hash_col=unhex(md5('data'));

2017-01-11 15:11:15	aradapilot	select from table where md5_hash_col=unhex('1b2c4f...');
2017-01-11 15:11:51	aradapilot	you can pass the raw binary too, but a lot of people work with hashes in hex (base16), so you need unhex()
