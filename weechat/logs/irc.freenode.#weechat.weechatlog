2016-12-14 12:59:55	LordRyan	go.py isn't too bad probably
2016-12-14 13:00:17	Krillbat	I was looking at the code for go.py
2016-12-14 13:00:31	Krillbat	And while i don't code per se, i couldn't help but notice it's like 100's LOC
2016-12-14 13:00:32	sim642	If you're going to have 99 buffers then you're bound to be using go.py before you get that many
2016-12-14 13:00:57	Krillbat	I just make an alias for /buffer to /b and then /b #
2016-12-14 13:01:11	sim642	it's not an alias
2016-12-14 13:01:19	sim642	go.py has an interactive thing in the input bar
2016-12-14 13:01:19	Krillbat	I know it isn't, it's a script

2016-12-16 10:41:52	sim642	It's just confusing when you expect it to work but it doesn't and that goes unnoticed
2016-12-16 10:42:47	sim642	But if you think it should be changed then discuss it with FlashCode or maybe even open an issue
2016-12-16 10:46:09	@FlashCode	Desu: I prefer being connected and not identified on the server, rather than waiting hours for SASL to be fixed for example
2016-12-16 10:48:25	@FlashCode	weechat gives priority to connection rather than authentication by default
2016-12-16 10:49:26	sim642	Actually now thinking about it in those terms, irc.network.sasl_fail_unavailable defaults to true
2016-12-16 10:49:48	sim642	Which is against that being connected priority
2016-12-16 10:50:52	sim642	I would be to blame for it
2016-12-16 10:52:03	sim642	Actually nevermind
2016-12-16 10:52:16	sim642	if sasl_fail is default continue it doesn't matter
2016-12-16 10:52:39	sim642	sasl_fail_unavailable only makes a difference when you use reconnect or disconnect for sasl_value

2016-12-16 10:56:29	Vigdis	Hi, I'm switching from irssi to weechat, the only thing I miss is moving aroung windows and I can't find the command in https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_user.en.html#key_bindings_buffers_windows is it possible?
2016-12-16 10:57:24	sim642	You mean change buffer numbers?
2016-12-16 10:57:47	Vigdis	I guess
2016-12-16 10:58:01	Vigdis	like I have a chan in buffer 8 and I want it in buffer 4
2016-12-16 10:58:28	sim642	/help buffer
2016-12-16 10:58:31	sim642	There's a move command
2016-12-16 10:59:13	Vigdis	oh, buffer and windows are not the same thing
2016-12-16 10:59:15	Vigdis	thanks

2016-12-28 14:20:28	aaronm04	Hi, what's the region on the left side of the screen where the nicks are listed (to the left of what is said in the channel)?
2016-12-28 14:20:39	aaronm04	I want to force it to be narrower even when there are really long nicks
2016-12-28 14:21:01	aaronm04	I guess what I _really_ want is to force the region containing what is said to be wider
2016-12-28 14:22:22	Random832	aaronm04, there are a couple settings for that
2016-12-28 14:23:08	aaronm04	cool, which settings?
2016-12-28 14:23:21	Random832	aaronm04, /set *prefix_align* - you can set the max width and it will truncate any longer nicks, or you can just turn it off
2016-12-28 14:24:39	aaronm04	 /set weechat.look.prefix_align_max 16 ?
2016-12-28 14:25:27	aaronm04	oh yeah, that helps a lot, thanks!

2017-01-05 13:10:04	Trel|Mobile	Out of curiosity, does using the letter "j" have significance in the alt+j hotkey for buffer switching?

2017-01-06 14:58:37	Elizabeth	irc.server.freenode.autojoin -> doesn't seem to quite work with double pound channels
2017-01-06 14:59:17	Zarthus	i doubt that's true.
2017-01-06 14:59:32	Zarthus	Do you have an example of a channel that doesn't work for you?
2017-01-06 14:59:40	Elizabeth	##somerandomchannel
2017-01-06 14:59:44	Zarthus	I'd wager it's more likely +r that's preventing you from joining.
2017-01-06 14:59:49	Elizabeth	SASL :p
2017-01-06 14:59:58	Zarthus	anything in the status window?
2017-01-06 15:00:01	Elizabeth	what I notice is that I'll autojoin the channel with one #
2017-01-06 15:00:14	Zarthus	Did you accidentally space separate the list?
2017-01-06 15:00:18	Elizabeth	but not the double, regardless of the channel (it could be a new one that doesn't exist)
2017-01-06 15:00:20	Elizabeth	nope
2017-01-06 15:00:31	Elizabeth	I'll have to test more on another instance,
2017-01-06 15:00:35	Zarthus	did you set it for the right server?
2017-01-06 15:00:40	Elizabeth	yes
2017-01-06 15:00:58	Zarthus	yeah, I don't know then. But I'm pretty confident the bug isn't that it's because of two pound symbols :P
2017-01-06 15:01:22	Zarthus	you might want to paste the full .autojoin value if privacy is not a concern
2017-01-06 15:02:00	Elizabeth	unfortunately, in my case it's a privacy concern

2017-01-06 15:03:29	Elizabeth	(in the weechat repos)
2017-01-06 15:03:33	Zarthus	yeah, I can't reproduce then.
2017-01-06 15:03:43	Zarthus	Considering I have double pound channels in my list :P
2017-01-06 15:03:44	Elizabeth	I'm setting up a test client
2017-01-06 15:03:55	Elizabeth	I'm wondering if a script is playing funky :p
2017-01-06 15:04:06	Zarthus	you could print them all to the channel with /script list -o i think

2017-01-11 10:21:37	aam	hello -- is there a way for a plugin to "replace" text within a buffer on-demand (as in, after it has been processed already, and in a way where it can be replaced back to the original value)?
2017-01-11 10:22:15	Zarthus	aam: scripts yeah, but a trigger can also do it
2017-01-11 10:22:29	Zarthus	scripts are just code, if you can set it you can unset it
2017-01-11 10:23:02	aam	so I'm looking to make something like a bad word filter that I can enable and disable at will (ie when I'm at work, etc)
2017-01-11 10:23:06	aam	what would you say is the best way to do it?

2017-01-11 10:23:39	sim642	modifier hooks can modify things like lines printed in a buffer
2017-01-11 10:23:43	sim642	but they are applied once
2017-01-11 10:24:01	aam	right that's what I was trying to say, this would modify it at will and after it has been received/processed
2017-01-11 10:24:04	Zarthus	bad word filters are generally ineffective.
2017-01-11 10:24:06	aam	and be able to change back
2017-01-11 10:24:24	Zarthus	If your boss takes issue with seeing "shit" on your screen, don't irc at work.

2017-01-11 10:26:24	sim642	they're the only things which modify data going through weechat internals
2017-01-11 10:26:38	aam	okay, there

2017-01-11 10:30:49	aam	thanks for sharing your thoughts though
2017-01-11 10:30:54	sim642	it's probably easier to just /filter things
2017-01-11 10:31:06	sim642	because filters can be enabled/disabled with ease
2017-01-11 10:31:33	aam	oh, right, I'll definitely look at that
2017-01-11 10:31:55	Zarthus	yeah but his usecase is for words like shit, which means he'll miss out on half the conversation :P

2017-01-11 13:34:29	@nils_2	but there are no emojis in elky screenshot. it happens when he "scroll up" not when a line is displayed.
2017-01-11 13:34:50	@nils_2	for me its a common refresh problem from terminal
2017-01-11 13:35:00	elky	nils_2: the emoji one would fit with what happened with opal's lines
2017-01-11 13:35:20	elky	the ones that made me ditch konsole
2017-01-11 13:35:22	@nils_2	elky, try /REDRAW
2017-01-11 13:35:31	bin_bash	nils_2: you can't see it in his screenshot, but it's there
2017-01-11 13:36:06	bin_bash	could be the upside down characters possibly, not sure
2017-01-11 13:36:12	elky	nils_2: for which issue? i already ditched moved back to konsole (and am currently mourning the loss of the right click menu terminator has)
2017-01-11 13:36:20	bin_bash	brb
2017-01-11 13:36:37	@nils_2	for the one with the screenshot
2017-01-11 13:37:07	elky	nils_2: sec i'll swap to terminator to check
2017-01-11 13:37:22	bin_bash	terminator is vte too, so it should happen there as well
2017-01-11 13:37:23	@nils_2	and as you can see in the screenshot, i am in the channel and i don't have that issue!
2017-01-11 13:37:30	bin_bash	nils_2: what terminal do you use
2017-01-11 13:37:49	@nils_2	i am using different terminals, depends on the machine i am using
2017-01-11 13:37:56	bin_bash	right now what are you using
2017-01-11 13:38:18	elky	k so /redraw straightened stuff back out
2017-01-11 13:38:24	bin_bash	ya

2017-01-11 13:39:11	elky	no idea
2017-01-11 13:40:10	@nils_2	i mean "straightened stuff back out"
2017-01-11 13:40:17	@nils_2	display is correct?
2017-01-11 13:40:23	@nils_2	after /REDRAW
2017-01-11 13:40:27	elky	nils_2: as in it stopped looking like a scatterbomb hit it, yes
2017-01-11 13:40:43	@nils_2	and when you scroll up/down the screen is messy again?
2017-01-11 13:41:11	elky	correct
2017-01-11 13:41:16	@nils_2	as i said, a terminal (refresh) issue.
2017-01-11 13:41:37	@nils_2	no emoji problem. i can scroll in #freenode without any problems
2017-01-11 13:41:52	elky	that doesn't help me other than indicate i have to swap terminals depending on who is talking in #freenode
