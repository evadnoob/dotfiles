2016-12-14 13:15:23	sebboh	And that's true in the latest virtualbox, too?
2016-12-14 13:15:37	sebboh	I have opengl 2.1 now, according to glxinfo.
2016-12-14 13:15:49	towo`	then you have the answer
2016-12-14 13:18:04	sebboh	I had no reason to assume that I have the correct packages installed, I certainly don't have the latest virtualbox installed, etc.  I installed xorg by hand picking a few packages and creating my own ~/.xsession file...  I thought maybe I wasn't currently getting the most 3D support available..
2016-12-14 13:19:15	towo`	afaik nothing changed on vbox and opengl has not a high priority by the vbox devs

2016-12-14 15:14:44	jethro	awal1: this is an intentional change. you can contral that behavior with kernel.dmesg_restrict sysctl
2016-12-14 15:15:12	jethro	it is documented in the changelog
2016-12-14 15:15:38	awal1	jethro: ok, thanks! I'll check the changelog
2016-12-14 15:16:07	awal1	I won't log as root everytime I want to use dmesg :P
2016-12-14 15:16:32	jethro	heard of sudo ? :)
2016-12-14 15:16:43	awal1	too much news/changelogs everyday under Sid; impossible to follow them all 
2016-12-14 15:16:56	jethro	that's why you should install apt-listchanges
2016-12-14 15:17:31	bremner	also, journalctl -b -f mostly replaces dmesg
2016-12-14 15:18:35	awal1	jethro: yeah, I have sudo enabled. But I forget to use it being used to su. And yeah, I have apt-listchanges installed and running. I mean no time for check closely all news/changelogs durring upgrades
2016-12-14 15:26:49	awal1	Installing "spice-vdagent" enables copy/paste between host and guest under qemu-kvm and it worked fine until today :P
