2016-12-14 10:46:24	bahamat	At any rate, I don't plan to upgrade every node on every release.
2016-12-14 10:46:48	@coderanger	Sure, every release is a but much, but I think 10 months is longer than I would go for
2016-12-14 10:46:53	bahamat	I have far too many nodes for that. I'm also using chef to save time, not make more work for myself.

2016-12-14 10:49:03	bahamat	To give you an indication, I'm working on upgrading from chef 11.6.0, and trying to convert form chef-solo to chef-zero.

2016-12-14 12:10:27	@coderanger	That's not a chef repo

2016-12-15 11:46:36	@coderanger	nymous: Basically define in terms of roles of servers, not "what does each server do"
2016-12-15 11:48:06	josephholsten	one question I've asked in this situation: what happens if we need to rebuild this server?
2016-12-15 11:48:18	josephholsten	what gets reused? what needs to change?
2016-12-15 11:49:10	josephholsten	and is it possible to automatically set up the bits that change? hostnames, certs, other IDs
2016-12-15 11:49:43	nymous	well, my puppet recipes are generic most of the time
2016-12-15 11:49:50	nymous	with few exceptions
2016-12-15 11:50:07	nymous	like mentioned before java app cluster with a master node

2016-12-15 11:50:36	nymous	master node is different from other nodes by just few lines in config
2016-12-15 11:51:06	josephholsten	so what happens if you need to change the master?
2016-12-15 11:51:07	nymous	so creating a duplicate recipe or duplicate config is something that i would rather avoid
2016-12-15 11:51:09	sauraus	What is the view here of running chef-client on a chef-server to manage a base config on the system?
2016-12-15 11:51:48	josephholsten	sauraus: almost always worth it, but occasionally "exciting" in the bootstrap phase

2016-12-15 11:52:06	nymous	with my current puppet setup, all i need is to change name in <% if hostname == 'node-00' %> block
2016-12-15 11:52:13	nymous	of config template
2016-12-15 11:52:51	josephholsten	sauraus: I used to use http://fnichol.github.io/knife-server/, but I don't know what's current
2016-12-15 11:54:55	josephholsten	nymous: well, you can keep doing that sort of thing in chef. I usually like to keep application level discovery outside chef (etcd or consul or zookeeper connections in the actual app), but there's nothing wrong with doing it at the chef level
2016-12-15 11:55:10	◥	geggam (~geggam@208.115.156.208) has joined #chef
2016-12-15 11:55:47	josephholsten	you just get slower failover procedures, or ones that involve a manual puppet/chef run
2016-12-15 11:56:30	nymous	my actual problem is that i need to be as generic as possible, but also allow other users (developers) change configs without messing everything up
2016-12-15 11:56:59	nymous	they currently just push into puppet's git with history and rollback if needed
2016-12-15 11:58:05	josephholsten	ah, you guys are using a single module repo, not separate module repos and r10k or similar?
2016-12-15 11:58:38	nymous	yup, single module repo, but with r10k
2016-12-15 11:59:14	josephholsten	well, you can do something similar for chef
2016-12-15 11:59:33	josephholsten	you'd have a repo that's like your hiera & puppetfile
2016-12-15 12:00:16	josephholsten	you basically have a repo with roles, environments, data_bags, &c
2016-12-15 12:00:36	josephholsten	if you absolutely have to, you can keep node json there as well
2016-12-15 12:01:06	josephholsten	see https://docs.chef.io/knife_upload.html

2016-12-15 12:02:06	josephholsten	I strongly recommend avoiding them ;-)
2016-12-15 12:02:39	josephholsten	you can stick version pins in environment json
2016-12-15 12:03:07	nymous	well, the only reason to have them is if we would need to deploy new version of our app differently
2016-12-15 12:03:18	nymous	it rarely occurs, but might happen
2016-12-15 12:03:35	josephholsten	also, if you have a separate chef server for each environment, you could push from different branches
2016-12-15 12:04:21	josephholsten	yeah, we've spent like the last 3 years trying to move from a puppet repo with a dev, stage, and prod branch into a single unified puppet repo branch
2016-12-15 12:05:29	josephholsten	if you can use feature flags and config /data/ to manage the difference between environments, you may enjoy it more
2016-12-15 12:08:02	nymous	hope i wouldn't mess things up much with chef :D
2016-12-15 12:08:41	nymous	after 2 years with puppet we mostly use it to deploy config update to a cluster
2016-12-15 12:09:23	nymous	and i had difficult times trying implement actions which aren't in stdlib
2016-12-15 12:09:40	josephholsten	we pretty much use it to roll out our system base, then use ansible for deploys
2016-12-15 12:09:45	nymous	i like ruby and making lots of small tools with thor and rake
2016-12-15 12:10:26	nymous	so i hope to get more freedom and power with chef
2016-12-15 12:10:53	josephholsten	and we're trying to move as much config into a live db like etcd, consul, zk or dynamo

2016-12-15 14:49:54	nymous	but each api call...
2016-12-15 14:50:23	biox	I am designing a cookbook that will install a webserver into a unique directory, and that dir has a unique owner/group. No two servers match. My current thought is to design the cookbook to make use of databag items named after the servers themselves - these databag items would then contain the appropriate directory/user/group/etc information for that server. Does that sound like an appropriate design to you
2016-12-15 14:50:26	biox	guys? My other options (that I can think of) are using attributes (where to define them is the question) or doing some crazy in-recipe logic that I haven't begun to think about
2016-12-15 14:51:08	biox	I guess the attributes would have to be defined per-node, since the uniqueness lies with the node.
2016-12-15 14:52:55	cookie559	biox: I usually use attributes for configuration and data bags for some sensitive information
2016-12-15 14:52:57	rgiscard	nymous: i'm following up w chef's sales peeps tomorrow on the same topic. 8-)
2016-12-15 14:54:02	cookie559	biox: also you can declare 1 attribute at environment level for all nodes using hash style per each server
2016-12-15 14:54:29	biox	cookie559: what do you mean by that last part?
2016-12-15 14:55:03	cookie559	biox: {'server1' => params, 'server2' => params}
2016-12-15 14:55:11	biox	I think it would make sense to set attributes on the node-level, but my concern is that it'll be very hard to maintain after a few dozen cookbooks are like that...
2016-12-15 14:55:18	biox	oh interesting
2016-12-15 14:56:13	cookie559	biox: than it is easy to match with node[:name] or something like that
2016-12-15 14:57:10	biox	cookie559: there's a disconnect for me somewhere. Why is setting those variables at the environment level better than setting them at the node level - or better yet just using node['hostname']?
2016-12-15 14:57:52	cookie559	biox: what do you mean by node level?
2016-12-15 14:57:55	nymous	rgiscard: no limitations are specified on the website, all I found is 2014's blog post saying everything is free and opensource, but you will get nag message if you use enterprise features and have more than 25 nodes
2016-12-15 14:58:06	biox	cookie559: i mean setting attributes on a per-node basis.
2016-12-15 14:58:12	nymous	which features are enterprise i'm unsure
2016-12-15 14:58:18	nymous	seems to be manage
2016-12-15 14:58:30	rgiscard	nymous: reporting and analytics
2016-12-15 14:59:08	nymous	so if i don't need them, i'm on the safe side, right?
2016-12-15 14:59:12	cookie559	biox: not sure how it is possible, attributes are seen for all nodes, but they have different priority(precedence)
2016-12-15 14:59:26	nymous	i mean staying free and opensource
2016-12-15 14:59:28	biox	cookie559: oh really? i must be misunderstanding how they work.
2016-12-15 14:59:58	biox	my thought was that node attributes have the highest priority (over role and env attributes)
2016-12-15 15:00:12	rgiscard	numous: i'm having the same quandry. i'm sure sales will clarify. the enterprise seems to be now wrapped into product called 'chef automate'
2016-12-15 15:00:14	cookie559	biox: the thing is where you can declare attribute in cookbook/environment/etc.
2016-12-15 15:00:41	cookie559	biox: and define its precedence: default/override/etc.
2016-12-15 15:01:10	cookie559	biox: but they are seen in context of whole organization
2016-12-15 15:01:55	nymous	rgiscard: the docs say: Proprietary Chef productssuch as Chef Automate and the Chef Management Consoleare governed by the Chef Master License and Services Agreement (Chef MLSA), which must be accepted as part of any install or upgrade process.
2016-12-15 15:02:05	biox	cookie559: right, I understand that. What has me confused is this: "also you can declare 1 attribute at environment level for all nodes using hash style per each server" - why would I want to do that?
2016-12-15 15:02:32	rgiscard	nymous: yep. it's not crystal clear what is what.
2016-12-15 15:02:37	cookie559	biox: you can do it in cookbook no problem with that
2016-12-15 15:03:02	cookie559	biox: but if you have different environments - you can do it per environment
2016-12-15 15:03:37	biox	cookie559: i see what you're saying. i guess the problem with these webservers is that no two will be alike. :/
2016-12-15 15:03:38	rgiscard	nymous: i search for this very issue via botbot (https://botbot.me/freenode/chef/) and we are not the only ones who are confused.
2016-12-15 15:04:17	cookie559	biox: in our company we have around 30 development environments/organizations and the same attributes have different values per each environment
2016-12-15 15:04:41	cookie559	biox: if you have 1 single environment, cookbook is good candidate for setting up attributes
2016-12-15 15:05:06	cookie559	biox: but you can customize it at environment level, since it has higher precedence
2016-12-15 15:06:17	biox	cookie559: ah okay. but in my case since each node is unique, why not just change the node attributes instead of the environment attributes? (via knife node edit X)
2016-12-15 15:07:55	cookie559	biox: I think if you do something manually than there is a thing to improve
2016-12-15 15:08:11	cookie559	biox: I prefer doing it through configuration
2016-12-15 15:09:21	biox	I agree with you, but sadly there is no way we can tell which directory/user/group combo will be used per-server, someone will have to type it in somewhere.

2016-12-16 11:24:36	@coderanger	then doesn't really matter

2016-12-16 11:26:02	thun	yes it uses ohai for max memory, does some normalization on the value, multiplies by a percentage (percentage is another attribute set above this call)
2016-12-16 11:26:15	thun	so its kind of ugly
2016-12-16 11:27:04	@coderanger	The "multiplies by another attr" is the key bit there
2016-12-16 11:27:11	@coderanger	You can't do that in a normal attr file
2016-12-16 11:27:24	@coderanger	Either use poise-derived or do it in a recipe

2016-12-22 10:42:01	eugenmayer1	at least for us, it is working out
2016-12-22 10:42:46	@cheeseplus	nobody has paid us for A/UX support...yet

2016-12-22 10:43:19	@cheeseplus	eugenmayer1: sure but that is mixing mediums, you wouldn't run those apps on windows
2016-12-22 10:43:50	@cheeseplus	but folks have lots of legacy apps and .NET out there, also workstation configuration is a thing for some companies
2016-12-22 10:43:52	eugenmayer1	are we talking about the chef-server or chef-client? ( did i got confused? )
2016-12-22 10:44:00	@cheeseplus	chef-client
2016-12-22 10:44:03	eugenmayer1	oh!
2016-12-22 10:44:08	@cheeseplus	chef-server will never run on windows
2016-12-22 10:44:17	@cheeseplus	too many deps that simply wouldn't compile
2016-12-22 10:44:18	eugenmayer1	chefr-client support is key to me, also for OSX
2016-12-22 10:44:33	@cheeseplus	also erlang on windows is generally pretty sad
2016-12-22 10:44:38	eugenmayer1	so simply ignore my comment - once again ( or just always :) )

2016-12-22 10:45:04	@cheeseplus	we support a lot loss on the server side

2016-12-22 10:45:12	@cheeseplus	it's pretty much Ubuntu and RHEL
2016-12-22 10:45:28	Scoth	It was actaully pretty slick, but required super-high specced computer for the time so it was really only used as servers and high-end workstations

2016-12-22 10:47:26	eugenmayer1	cheeseplus: i have to maintain a windows build-server myself, so having chef there is neat.. but i am not sure how this will work..
2016-12-22 10:47:27	jlockwood	my ASCII emoji skills died with Q3A gaming. . . it's prolly for the best ;-)

2016-12-22 10:48:06	@cheeseplus	chef was the only one that worked and supported powershell natively
2016-12-22 10:48:33	Scoth	We chose chef over puppet mostly because of better Windows support, which was important to us
2016-12-22 10:48:52	eugenmayer1	cheeseplus: how is chef provisioned on windows? We use some commercial ssh-daemon to work with the box..but that is not there by default

2016-12-22 10:49:08	eugenmayer1	Scoth: that was the ONLY reason??? Thats a clear offense
2016-12-22 10:49:17	@cheeseplus	not really
2016-12-22 10:49:22	Scoth	It wasn't the only reason, but it was a pretty big one
2016-12-22 10:49:22	@cheeseplus	that is why lots of folks choose chef
2016-12-22 10:49:26	jlockwood	Grasping at straws, but, is there any .Net minimum version as a pre-req?
2016-12-22 10:49:46	eugenmayer1	For me it is. Puppet is the biggest pain i do  encounter in my daily office right now

2016-12-22 10:53:26	@cheeseplus	there are mechanisms for cookbooks to be adopted or taken over but you generally need the original author to set that up
2016-12-22 10:53:26	eugenmayer1	well the original author is probably not ever going to answer - at least he did not on my pull request
2016-12-22 10:53:26	@cheeseplus	there is some more official stuff coming by way of RFC
2016-12-22 10:53:40	eugenmayer1	you told me yes, but well, for now, i have to deal with it myself
2016-12-22 10:54:04	@cheeseplus	right, for the short term prefix is the best solution
2016-12-22 10:54:25	@cheeseplus	it's the same problem as rubygems largely, one big flat namespace in which the first comer secures it
2016-12-22 10:54:55	eugenmayer1	yeah, it becomes an issue for all this rubygems like ecosystems
2016-12-22 10:55:40	eugenmayer1	things become big, a lot of developers, a lot of distraction thus a lot of dead projects / gems whatever. Taking over would be a real good thing
2016-12-22 10:55:54	eugenmayer1	i think, most of them should adopt to what github does, fork - visible forking
2016-12-22 10:56:01	@cheeseplus	right but there are fundamental issues with taking over
2016-12-22 10:56:02	eugenmayer1	so if i see a project being dead, i look at the forks
2016-12-22 10:56:20	@cheeseplus	it's not clear cut nor easy, trust me we've spent years discussing this
2016-12-22 10:56:28	eugenmayer1	and i basically need a "fetch" DSL which lets me easily select ah fork ( by author name )

2016-12-22 10:57:29	@cheeseplus	it's an artifact repo, not source
2016-12-22 10:57:30	eugenmayer1	same tought sourceforge.
2016-12-22 10:57:45	eugenmayer1	every cookbook has its source
2016-12-22 10:57:56	@cheeseplus	sure but they may not be forks in GH
2016-12-22 10:58:06	@cheeseplus	and source_urls weren't enforced until fairly recently
2016-12-22 10:58:19	eugenmayer1	it does not matter. I am talking about the mechanic of fork, that means, a derived work, and improvement, but tracked down to its root
2016-12-22 10:58:33	@cheeseplus	I mean your ideas are welcome but this has been a thing we've been trying to solve since forever in the community
2016-12-22 10:58:47	eugenmayer1	being a source-fork should be optional but encouraged ( if it is not a rewrite )
2016-12-22 10:58:57	@cheeseplus	it's easy to postulate about, hard to solve holistically once it's in motion
2016-12-22 10:59:08	eugenmayer1	point given
2016-12-22 10:59:29	@cheeseplus	I encourage you to join the discussions though via summit or our dev meetings
2016-12-22 10:59:43	@cheeseplus	the bigger concern has long been quality metrics
2016-12-22 11:00:12	@cheeseplus	those are finally surfacing but we're incubating it to get some data as "quality" is a hard thing to nail
2016-12-22 11:00:35	eugenmayer1	that is as unsolveable as taking over is. Let quality be decided by the consumer. Try to get ratings into their ways, as you already use followers for that
2016-12-22 11:00:35	@cheeseplus	also why best practices are super hard
2016-12-22 11:00:59	@cheeseplus	people game it and the counts for download/followers aren't as reliable as we'd like
2016-12-22 11:01:06	eugenmayer1	this will decide over quality, but also, you should calculate quality yourself. Rating + laste update + downloads
2016-12-22 11:01:28	eugenmayer1	adding an explicit metric, which should be high-weighted, is very very important
2016-12-22 11:01:39	eugenmayer1	but the problem with explicit is, getting people to use it

2016-12-22 11:02:01	eugenmayer1	that is partially a social issue, but also a technical one.
2016-12-22 11:02:09	@cheeseplus	precisely
2016-12-22 11:02:12	@cheeseplus	humans are messy
2016-12-22 11:02:35	@cheeseplus	also we default to more open than most which means sometimes we can't make dictatorial decisions
2016-12-22 11:02:42	@cheeseplus	pros and cons
2016-12-22 11:02:57	eugenmayer1	if you do not start to rule in supermarket, its ecosystem will implode
2016-12-22 11:03:30	@cheeseplus	meh, that assertion has been made a bunch and holds up only sometimes

2016-12-22 11:04:27	eugenmayer1	cheeseplus: do not underestimate how this works. The important mechanic is - it needs a amount of fuzzyness per cookbook, a critical mass in avg how many alternatives you have

2016-12-22 11:05:59	@cheeseplus	I've heard
2016-12-22 11:06:27	eugenmayer1	its as bad as i do not even try to contribute, i simply run an offsite catalog - open on github
2016-12-22 11:06:27	@cheeseplus	at least with habitat we went with the github/dockerhub style naming
2016-12-22 11:06:39	eugenmayer1	that makes a lot of sense
2016-12-22 11:06:52	@cheeseplus	with cookbooks we have the prefix thing finally

2016-12-22 11:06:59	@cheeseplus	but back compat will kill us

2016-12-22 11:12:03	Scoth	I actually did get an Elasticsearch client node running on a 33mhz 68k Mac on Linux, but that's because I'm a huge nerd.
2016-12-22 11:12:15	eugenmayer1	i admit, you are!
2016-12-22 11:12:38	Scoth	It ran... very poorly, but dammit, it worked
2016-12-22 11:12:44	eugenmayer1	i am in the middle of migrating for ES 2.4 to 5.1 .. its .. interesting
2016-12-22 11:13:06	Scoth	We're angling that way too, but not in any great hurry
2016-12-22 11:13:35	Scoth	I've been working on a bunch of chef cookbooks to automate deployment of our entire elk stack. It's been fun
2016-12-22 11:13:42	eugenmayer1	Well i do not know why we used 2.0.0 deprecated API when writing against the 2.4 api early this year..this is so … not good
2016-12-22 11:14:23	eugenmayer1	Scoth: ELK will be my huge topic for 2017, due to our massive move on docker. Yet not there, we use ES for search, facetted and all this near kind of stuff
2016-12-22 11:15:07	Scoth	Our cluster is still relatively small and simple, so we're not anticipating too much trouble. Just one of those things on the backlog
2016-12-22 11:15:10	eugenmayer1	Scoth: interestingly, we migrated from apachesolr 1.4 to es 2.4 (huuuuuuge step) and the performance is .. wow. Indexingin..wow.. its impressive how things improve over 4 years
2016-12-22 11:15:14	Scoth	The chef recipes should help
2016-12-22 11:15:45	Scoth	I think we started with es 2.2 or 2.3 only earlier this year (like January or February) so we don't have too much legacy
2016-12-22 11:16:06	eugenmayer1	Well we had to rewrite the querybuilder is ruby, php and typescript - took us some time. Now some aggregations are still broken and one thing i give you upfront, not site plugins anymore. No kopf, no head, not nothing

2016-12-22 11:46:16	Dannenberg	is this the right place to go for inspec help as well? i'd like to describe a file whose name changes based on an attribute... how might one do this?
2016-12-22 11:47:12	@cheeseplus	you can definitely ask
2016-12-22 11:47:39	@cheeseplus	so for starters, an inspec test (or any other black box type test) shouldn't be aware of the config mgmt settings
2016-12-22 11:48:12	@cheeseplus	so you'd probably be best off writing a suite where that attribute is set to a value, then test for that specific value with inspec
2016-12-22 11:48:24	perniciouscaffei	cool. thanks!
2016-12-22 11:48:51	Dannenberg	cheeseplus: hmm alright, suppose that attribute is an OS value, should it be separate suites for each OS?
2016-12-22 11:49:01	@cheeseplus	it depends
2016-12-22 11:49:08	Dannenberg	upon?
2016-12-22 11:49:11	@cheeseplus	give more context and I could tell you more
2016-12-22 11:49:21	@cheeseplus	what value are you trying to test for
2016-12-22 11:49:37	Dannenberg	i have cookbook which sets up a repo, the repo name (and the assorted files related there to) contain the OS major version
2016-12-22 11:50:57	Dannenberg	so instead of /etc/yum.repos.d/repo-name-centos-6 i'll need to check /etc/yum.repos.d/repo-name-centos-7
2016-12-22 11:51:41	@cheeseplus	so you can test for a regex or use the resources inspec provides to construct it
2016-12-22 11:51:46	Dannenberg	it seems like node attributes are available inside describe blocks, but as you mentioned i shouldn't be trying to whitebox test via inspec
2016-12-22 11:52:04	Dannenberg	can i use a regex for the file path?
2016-12-22 11:52:22	Dannenberg	describe file(/etc/yum.repos.d/repo-name-centos-[67]) ?

2016-12-22 11:55:22	Dannenberg	ahhh thanks
2016-12-22 11:55:42	@cheeseplus	if you dump attributes to feed the black box testing, at least in my mind, that is cheating at the test

I'm setting up a monitoring recipe that requires external services to be up to work, but it gets applied to all nodes to it could prevent the services it depends from starting if it gets in the run list too early.  I'd like to ignore_failure but not have the run report success.

2017-01-09 11:03:22	izghitu	ok, thanks
2017-01-09 11:03:22	@cheeseplus	encryption was added which requires some config changes

2017-01-09 11:04:51	izghitu	cheeseplus, another unrelated question, is there any way to enforce chef-server nginx to not listen on port 80 at all?
2017-01-09 11:05:06	izghitu	do I just manually modify the nginx configs?

2017-01-09 11:05:53	@cheeseplus	besides, chef-server doesn't care about 80 as much as 443
2017-01-09 11:06:09	izghitu	yes but I have apache running on same server on port 80
2017-01-09 11:06:18	izghitu	and each time I reconfigure chef-server
2017-01-09 11:06:21	izghitu	I can't properly start nginx
2017-01-09 11:06:24	@cheeseplus	yea you probably shouldn't do that
2017-01-09 11:06:31	izghitu	because it has a listen 80 in its configs
2017-01-09 11:06:35	@cheeseplus	like running something else on the same box as chef-server

2017-01-10 11:12:12	JediDredd	Well idea is to run all seperate components of Chef server in independent docker containers, i.e run entire chef-server as a pod, running chef server in a single container works but its very heavy.
2017-01-10 11:13:06	@coderanger	Sure, that's an idea, it's just a shitton of work and you'll be starting from scratch

2017-01-10 11:16:25	@coderanger	chef558: There are none
2017-01-10 11:16:43	Scoth	coderanger: Aye. I think we initially misunderestimated the resourced it'd need and rather undersizes the VM. Once we got it sized up it was fine
2017-01-10 11:16:45	chef558	i think there is one
2017-01-10 11:16:56	chef558	as mentioned

2017-01-10 11:20:36	@coderanger	If you mean for Chef Server itself, one option is the commercial chef-backend system from Chef Software
2017-01-10 11:20:43	@coderanger	Or you can build something yourself
2017-01-10 11:20:51	@coderanger	Or use AWS services, etc etc
2017-01-10 11:20:53	chef558	ok
2017-01-10 11:20:58	chef558	ok
2017-01-10 11:21:01	@coderanger	Lots of options, up to you to compare them
2017-01-10 11:21:37	chef558	so  if i have all  the cookbooks, roles, environment in my source code repo
2017-01-10 11:21:56	chef558	i can easily  survive incase of any node failure etc
2017-01-10 11:22:12	@coderanger	Depends on your workflow
2017-01-10 11:22:21	chef558	i mean chef server
2017-01-10 11:22:27	@coderanger	I know
2017-01-10 11:23:04	@coderanger	Generally node data and policy rollouts live solely in the Chef Server database so you would need backups of that too
2017-01-10 11:23:18	chef558	actually what i want to build is i want to build a CI pipeline where if I do a commit it should do a thorough check
2017-01-10 11:23:26	@coderanger	The rest should live in git though recovering it may be difficult (like if you need to re-upload every cookbook version because somewhere an old version is pinned)
2017-01-10 11:23:39	chef558	i used to do that with puppet called puppetlint
2017-01-10 11:24:10	chef558	hmm

2017-01-10 11:26:40	chef558	when i do  a commit both can be used

2017-01-10 16:58:58	@coderanger	Basically just make each system try and connect to the database each time, if it fails it just dies and tries again in a few minutes when the next converge happens
2017-01-10 17:00:40	loth	yep sounds right

2017-01-10 17:01:47	loth	oke, next question heh; does chef have an equivilent of a group variable? I need to add all members of the databases' ip address to the config file but would like it to be dynamic to how many hosts there are in the group
2017-01-10 17:02:43	loth	would be {% for host in groups['database'] %}{{ hostvars[host]['ansible_management']['ipv4']['address'] }}{% if not loop.last %},{% endif %}{% endfor %} in ansible
2017-01-10 17:03:18	loth	obv i can get the ip addr variable in chef but not sure if the group function exists
2017-01-10 17:03:30	@coderanger	Look up Chef Search
2017-01-10 17:03:59	@coderanger	It exists but is very simplistic compared to better service discovery tools like Consul
2017-01-10 17:04:08	@coderanger	But for simple things it might suffice :)

2017-01-11 14:13:31	cocopuffs	quick question about chef server user names. I noticed that you cant have . in the usernames like mister.puffs. Is this because of the way the names are stored in the db? Will this be a problem when integrating AD or LDAP if the usernames have dots in them?
