# If you really need to use these commands with their normal names, you
# can add a "gnubin" directory to your PATH from your bashrc like:

export PATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"

# Additionally, you can access their man pages with normal names if you add
# the "gnuman" directory to your MANPATH from your bashrc as well:

export MANPATH="/usr/local/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnuman:$MANPATH"
